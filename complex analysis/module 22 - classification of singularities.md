# Classification of Singularities

Given a Laurent series expansion of a function with an isolated singularity at $z_0$, we hvae the possibility of the singularity being removable, a pole, or an essential singularity.

A **removable singularity** occurs if all negative powers in the Laurent series are zero and the function can be redefined at the singularity to be analytic.

A **pole** is present if the Laurent series has a finite number of negative power terms. The largest negative exponent (in absolute value) indicates the order of the pole.

An **essential** singularity occurs if there are infinitely many negative powers in the Laurent series.
