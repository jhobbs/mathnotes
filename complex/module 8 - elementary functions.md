## Complex Exponential

The complex exponential function, $f(z) = e^z$, is defined as the unique solution of the differential equation $f'(z) = f(z)$ where $f(0) = 1$.

Solving this initial value problem gives the solution

$$ e^z = e^x \left ( \cos{(y)} + \sin{(y)} i\right ) \tag{a} $$

$e^z$ is an entire function.

Algebraic properties of $e$ hold such that the behavior matches that of the real exponential function, so

$$ e^{z_1} e^{z_2} = e^{z_1 + z_2}, $$

and

$$ e^{z_1} / e^{z_2} = e^{z_1 - z_2}. $$

When $x$ is $0$ in equation (a), we get

$$ e^{yi} = \cos{(y)} + \sin{(y)} i, $$

which is Euler's identity.
