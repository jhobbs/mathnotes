# Conditions for application

Partial fraction decomposition works when we have a rational expression of the form:

$$ f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} $$

where both $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are polynomials and the degree of $P(x)$ is strictly less than the degree of $Q(x)$.

If the degree of $P(x)$ is greater than or equal to the degree of $Q(x)$, perform long division first and work with the remainder term.

# Steps to Apply

First, factor the denominator as completely as possible. Then, we'll pick terms for each factor in the denominator.
