# Factoring cubics

## Sum and Difference of Cubes

Sum of cubes:

$$ a^3 + b^3 = (a+b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) $$

Difference of cubes:

$$ a^3 - b^3 = (a-b)(a^2 +ab + b^2) $$

Note that in both cases
* the first operation on the right side is the same as the operation on the left side
* the second operation on the right side is the opposite of the operation on the left side
* the third operation on the right side is always $+$
