# Groups

## Definition

A group, is a set $G$ together with a binary operation $\*$ such that:

**Closure**: The set is closed under the binary operation. For all $a, b \in G, a \* b \in G$.

**Associativity**: The binary operation is associative on the set. For all $a, b, c \in G, (a \* b) \* c = a \* (b \* c)$.

**Identity**: The set contains an identity element, denoted $e$. For all $a \in G, a \* e = a$.

**Inverses**: All elements in the set have inverse elements in the set, denoted using $a^{-1}$. For all $a \in G$ there exists $a^{-1} \in G$ such that $a \* a^{-1} = e$.

This set/operation combination $G$ is commonly denoted as the pair $(G, \*)$.

## Examples

Some examples of groups:

* The integers under addition: $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$. The identity element is $0$.

* The non-zero reals under multiplication: $(\mathbb{R}^{\*}, \*)$. The identity element is $1$.

* $n ~ x ~  n$ invertible matrices.

[Loads more listed here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Examples_of_groups).

A non-example is the naturals under addition - $(\mathbb{N}, +)$. The naturals are closed under addition, but there is no identity element since $0$ isn't included, and thus no inverses either.

## Abelian Groups

Abelian groups are groups whose operation is commutative. For $a,b \in G, a \* b = b \* g$.

The integers under addition are Abelian, because $a + b = b + a$, but invertible $n ~ x ~ n$ matrices are not, because it's not necessary that $AB = BA$.

## Finite Groups

The examples given so far are all infinite groups, but finite groups also exist.

For example, $(Z_4, +_4)$ i.e. $\\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$ together with addition mod $4$ is a finite group.

## Subgroups

A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is a subset of $G$ group together with the same operation as $G$ that still forms a group. The identity element of $G$ must also be the identity element of $H$.

For example, the even integers under addition, $(2\mathbb{Z}, +)$, are a subgroup of the integers under addition.

## Cyclic Groups

A **cyclic group** is a group where there exists some $g \in G$ such that every element in $G$ can be generated from the group operation applied to $g$.

That is, $G = \\{g^N \| n \in \mathbb{Z}\\}$ when we think of the operation as multiplication, or $G = \\{ng \| n \in \mathbb{Z}\\}$ when we think of the operation as addition.

We use angle brackets to denote an element as a generator. For example, $\langle 1 \rangle$ is a generator of $(\mathbb{N}, +)$, because every integer can be written as $n1$ for some $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.

The **order** of a finite group is the number of its elements. The order of group $G$ is denoted as $\\text{ord}{(G)}$ or $\|G\|$. The order of an element $a$ (also called period length or period) is the number of elements in the subgroup generated by $a$, and is denoted by $\text{ord}{(a)}$ or $\|a\|$.

### Cyclic Subgroups

Any subgroup of a cyclic group is also cyclic - a cyclic subgroup.

**Theorem**: Let $G = \langle a \rangle$ be a cyclic group with $n$ elements. Let $b \in G$ and $b = a^s$. Then $b$ generates a cyclic subgroup of $G$ containing $\frac{n}{d}$ elements, where $d = \gcd(s, n)$. Two cyclic subgroups $\langle a^s \rangle$ and $\langle a^t \rangle$ are equal if and only if $\gcd(s,n) = \gcd(t, n)$.

Suppose $g \in G$ with $\text{ord}(g) = n$ and let $m \in \mathbb{N}$. Then, $\langle g^m \rangle = \langle g^{\gcd{(m,n)}} \rangle$.

So, $ \langle g \rangle = \langle g^m \rangle \iff \gcd{(m,n)} = 1$.

Every element of a cyclic finite group will generate a cyclic subgroup. Some of these subgroups will be equivalent to others - we denote each subgroup $\langle g^s \rangle$, where $s$ is the smallest natural number that generates the subgroup.

To find the subgroups of a cyclic group, we follow this algorithm, keeping track of which elements we've found the generated subgroup for.

1. Some element $g$ will generator the entire group. If the group's order is $n$, then any element of the form $g^s$ where $s$ and $n$ are relatively prime will also generate the entire group, so note that we'v found the generated subgroup for all of those elements.

2. Starting with the next $g^s$ not covered already, find the subgroup generated by it - all elements of $G$ of the form $(g^s)^k$. Note the order of this subgroup and call it $t$. Any elements of $G$ of the form $r \dot g^s$ where $r$ is relatively prime with $t$ will generate the same subgroup. Note that we've found the generated subgroup for all of those elements.

3. Repeat step 2 until we've found the subgroup generated by all elements.

This sounds really abstract, so here's an example of finding all of the subgroups of $(Z_{20}, +_{20})$

The diagram in this image is called a subgroup diagram or subgroup lattice. It represents containment - so a node being higher on the digram indicates than any nodes below it are subsets of it.

## Permutations

If we rearrange the ordered set $A = \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ to another order, say $\\{3,2,5,1,4\\}$, then we get a permutation of $A$.

This rearrangement is a bijection from $A$ to $A$ that performs

$$ \begin{align} 1 \to 3 \\ 2 \to 2 \\ 3 \to 5 \\ 4 \to 1 \\ 5 \to 4 \end{align} $$

We can represent this permutation compactly using a matrix

$$ \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\ 3 & 2 & 5 & 1 & 4 \end{pmatrix} $$

Here, the top row is the input and the bottom row is the output, columnwise.

More formally, a perumtation is a bijection $\phi : A \to A$, that is, a bijection from a set onto itself. Generally, we talk about permutations on finite sets, but this doesn't seem to be a hard and fast rule.

The set of all permutations on the set $A$ is denoted by $S_A$:

$$ S_A = \{ \phi : A \to A | \phi \text{ is a bijection} \} $$

When $A$ is the finite set $\\{1, 2, 3, \cdots, n\\},$ the group of all permutations of $A$ is the symmetric group on $n$ letters, and is denoted by $S_n$. It has $n!$ elements.

Permutations can be "multiplied", which is just composition. So if we have two permutations on $A$, called $\sigma$ and $\tau$, $\sigma \tau$ means their multiplication, and we apply from right to left, so $\tau$ applies first and then $\sigma$. The result will also be a permutation in $A$.

Permutation multiplication of permutations of a set forms a group:

**Theorem**: Let $A$ be a nonempty set, and $S_A$ be the collection of all permutations of $A$. Then $S_A$ is a group under permutation multiplication.

### Orbits

Let $\sigma$ be a permutationf $A$, the orbit of $\sigma$ containing $a \in A$ is the set

$$ \{ \cdots, \sigma^{-2}(a), \sigma^{-1}(a), a, \sigma{(a)}, \sigma^{2}(a), \cdots \} = \{\sigma^n(a) | n \in \mathbb{Z}\}. $$

So, $a,b \in A$ are in the same orbit of $\sigma$, written as $a \~ b$, if and only if $b = \sigma^n(a)$ for some $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.

The relation "~" is an equivalent relation (reflexive, symmetric, transitive). This means $A$ can be partitioned into orbits of $\sigma$.

**Definition**: Let $\sigma$ be a permutation of $A$. The equivalence classes in $A$ determined by the equivalence relation "~" are the **orbits** of $\sigma$.

Example:

Consider $\sigma = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\\ 3 & 8 & 6 & 7 & 4 & 1 & 5 & 2 \end{pmatrix}$ in $S_8$. 
rbit of $\sigma = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\\ 3 & 8 & 6 & 7 & 4 & 1 & 5 & 2 \end{pmatrix}$ 

* containing 1 is $\\{1,3,6\\}$ because $\sigma(1) = 3$, $\sigma(3) = 6$, and $\sigma(6) = 1$.

* containing 2 is $\\{2,8\\}$.

* containing 4 is $\\{4, 5, 7\\}$.

So the orbits of $\sigma$ are $\\{1,3,6\\}, \\{2,8\\}, \\{4,5,7\\}$.

### Cycles

A permutation $\sigma \in S_n$ is a **cycle** if it has at most one orbit containing more than one elements. The length of a cycle is the number of elements in its largest orbit.

A cycle in $S_n$ may be written as $(a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_k)$ - this is called cyclic notation. It represents the permutation that sends $a_1 \to a_2 \to \cdots \to a_k \to a_1$. 

Two or more than two cycles are **disjoint** if no element appears in more than one cycle.

**Theorem**: every permutation $\sigma$ of a finite set is a product of disjoint cycles.

### Even and Odd Permutations

A cycle of length 2 is a **transposition**.

A permutation of a finite set is **even** if it is the product of an even number of tanspositions. It is odd if it is the product of an odd number of transpositions.

**Theorem**: A permutation in $S_n$ can be written as either a product of an odd number of transpositions or a product of an even number of transpositions, but not both.

The subgroup of $S_n$ consisting of all even permutations of $n$ letters is the **alternating group** $A_n$ on $n$ letters. If $n \geq 2$, then this set forms a subgroup of $S_n$ of order $n!/2$.

### Cosets

**Definition**: Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. Given $a \in G$, the subset $aH = \\{ah \| h \in H\\}$ of $G$ is the **left coset** of $H$ containing $a$, while the subset $Ha = \\{ha \| h \in H\\}$ is the **right coset** of $H$ containing $a$.

Example. Left cosets of subgroup $3\mathbb{Z}$ of $\mathbb{Z}$:

$$ \begin{align} 0 + 3\mathbb{Z} = \{\dots, -9, -6, 0, 3, 6, 9, \dots\} \\ 1 + 3\mathbb{Z} = \{\dots, -8, -5, 1, 4, 7, 10, \dots\} \\  2 + 3\mathbb{Z} = \{\dots, -7, -4, 2, 5, 8, 11, \dots\} \\  \end{align} $$

Some properties:

* If $aH \cap bH \neq \emptyset $, then $aH = bH$. This means we can partition $G$ into left cosets of $H$.

* If $G$ is Abelian, the left cosets and right cosets of $H$ will be equal. So, in the example above, $a + 3\mathbb{Z} = 3\mathbb{Z} + a$.

The number of left cosets of a subgroup $H$ in a group $G$ is the **index**  $(G:H)$ of $H$ in $G$. From the example above, the index of $3\mathbb{Z}$ in $\mathbb{Z}$ is $3$ since there are 3 left cosets.
