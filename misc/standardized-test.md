# Standardized Test Math

These are some notes from my preperation for a standardized math test.

## Geometry


### Interior Angles of Regular Polygons

The sum of the degrees of the interior angles of a regular $n$-gon is $180(n - 2)$. This can be shown by dividing the interior into triangles by picking one vertex and drawing diagonals to non opposing vertices. There will be $n-3$ non-adjacent vertices, resulting in $n-2$ triangles, each with $180$ degrees of interior angles.

### Parallel vs Non-Parallel Diagonals in a Regular Octagon

Given a regular octagon, are there more diagonals that are parallel to at least one side, more that are not parallel to at least one side, or are the two quantities equal?

There are $n$ vertices in a regular $n$-gon; each vertex is an endpoint for $n-3$ diagonals. However, each diagonal connects to two vertices, so we end up with $\frac{n(n-3)}{2}$ diagonals in a regular $n$-gon.
