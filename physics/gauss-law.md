# Gauss's Law

The electric flux $\Phi$ through a surface is the amount of electric field that pierces the surface.

Electric flux through a surface is defined by the dot product of the electric field vector $\vec{E}$ and the area vector $\vec{A}$:

$$ \Phi = \vec{E} \cdot \vec{A} $$

The area vector is a vector normal to a surface with a magnitude equal to the area of a surface.

In the simplest case where the electric field is uniform and perpendicular to a flat surface, the electric flux is simply the product of the electric field magnitude and the area of the surface:

$$ \Phi = E \times A $$

However, if the electric field is not perpendicular to the surface or if the surface is curved, the calculation integrates the electric field over the surface:

$$ \Phi = \int_S \vec{E} \cdot d \vec{A} $$

The net flux through a closed surface is given by:

$$ \Phi = \oint_S \vec{E} \cdot d \vec{A} $$

Gauss' law relates the electric field at points on a (closed) Gaussian surface to the net charge enclosed by that surface. An inward piercing field is negative flux. An outward piercing field is positive flux. A skimming field is zero flux.

Gauss' law relates the net flux $\Phi$ penetrating a closed surface to the net charge $q_{enc}$ enclosed by the surface:

$$ \epsilon_0 \Phi = q_{enc} $$

Gauss' law can also be written in terms of the electric field piercing the enclosing Gaussian surface:

$$ \epsilon_0 \oint \vec{E} \cdot d \vec{A} = q_{enc} $$ 

$$ \oint \vec{E} \cdot d \vec{A} = \frac{q_{enc}}{\epsilon_0} $$
