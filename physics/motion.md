# Energy, Work, Momentum

Kinetic Energy - scalar quantity, unit is joules. $v$ here is the magnitude of the velocity.

$$ KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 $$

kinetic energy is not conserved in inelastic collisions, but it is preserved in elastic collisions.


Work in a straight line, unit is joules, $f(x)$ is a potentially displacement varying force in the direction of displacement.

$$ W = \int_{x_1}^{x_2} f(x) dx $$


Work over some displacement for constant force in the direction of displacement:

$$ W = Fs $$

Hooke's law for springs. $F_s$ is the spring force (in newtons), $k$ is the spring constant (typically in newton-meters) and $x$ is the displacement (in meters).

$$ F_s = -kx $$

Work to reach a given displacement comes from integrating this:

$$ W = -\frac{k}{2} x^2 $$

Momentum - vector quantity, unit is $\frac{kg \cdot m}{s}$:

$$ \vec{P} = m\vec{v} $$

Momentum is conserved in collisions; For two objects, $a$ and $b$ colliding:


$$ m_{a_1} \vec{v}_{a_1} + m_{b_1} \vec{v}_{b_1} = m_{a_2} \vec{v}_{a_2} + m_{b_2} \vec{v}_{b_2} $$
