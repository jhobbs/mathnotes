# Newtonian Motion

## Energy, Work, Momentum

Kinetic Energy - scalar quantity, unit is joules. $v$ here is the magnitude of the velocity.

$$ KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 $$

kinetic energy is not conserved in inelastic collisions, but it is preserved in elastic collisions.


Work in a straight line, unit is joules, $f(x)$ is a potentially displacement varying force in the direction of displacement.

$$ W = \int_{x_1}^{x_2} f(x) dx $$


Work over some displacement for constant force in the direction of displacement:

$$ W = Fs $$

Hooke's law for springs. $F_s$ is the spring force (in newtons), $k$ is the spring constant (typically in newton-meters) and $x$ is the displacement (in meters).

$$ F_s = -kx $$

Work to reach a given displacement from the unstretched position comes from integrating this:

$$ W = -\frac{k}{2} x^2 $$

Momentum - vector quantity, unit is $\frac{kg \cdot m}{s}$:

$$ \vec{P} = m\vec{v} $$

Momentum is conserved in collisions; For two objects, $a$ and $b$ colliding:


$$ m_{a_1} \vec{v}_{a_1} + m_{b_1} \vec{v}_{b_1} = m_{a_2} \vec{v}_{a_2} + m_{b_2} \vec{v}_{b_2} $$

## Friction

There are two types of friction to consider, depending on if an object is moving or not. Static friction applies to an object at rest, and kinetic friction applies to an object in motion

The force from static friction is in a direction parallel to the surface an object is resting on, and opposite in direction but equal in magnitude to a force applied in parallel to the surface.

$$ F_s = \mu_s F_x $$

Here, $\mu_s$ is the coefficient of static friction (which is a property of the combination of the object and the surface) and $F_x$ is a force parallel to the surface.

The object will remain stationary until the static friction exceeds $F_{s_{max}}$, which is:

$$ F_{s_{max}} = \mu_s F_n $$

where $F_n$ is the normal force. Once the force exceeds that value, the object will begin moving.

An object in motion across a surface experiences kinetic friction, given by

$$ F_k = \mu_k F_n $$

where $\mu_k$ is the cofficient of kinetic friction. Generally, kinetic friction is less than static friction. The force from kinetic friction applies in the direction parallel to the surface but opposite in direction of the motion of the object.
