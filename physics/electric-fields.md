# Electric Fields

The electric field is a vector field that gives the force due to a charged particle in the surrounding space. The force on a test charge $q_0$ due to the particle with charge $q$ is

$$ \vec{F} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q q_0}{r^2} \hat{r} $$

Then, the electric field set up by the particle at the location of the test charge is

$$ \vec{E} = \frac{\vec{F}}{q_0}  = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r^2} \hat{r} $$

The magnitude of the electric field $\vec{E}$ set up by a particle with charge $q$ at distance $r$ from the particle is

$$ E  = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{|q|}{r^2} $$

Electric fields follow the principle of superposition - if we have multiple particles, we find the net electric field by adding the electric fields from each particle.
