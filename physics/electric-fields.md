# Electric Fields

The electric field is a vector field that gives the force due to a charged particle in the surrounding space. The force on a test charge $q_0$ due to the particle with charge $q$ is

$$ \vec{F} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q q_0}{r^2} \hat{r} $$

Then, the electric field set up by the particle at the location of the test charge is

$$ \vec{E} = \frac{\vec{F}}{q_0}  = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r^2} \hat{r} $$

The magnitude of the electric field $\vec{E}$ set up by a particle with charge $q$ at distance $r$ from the particle is

$$ E  = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{|q|}{r^2} $$

Electric fields follow the principle of superposition - if we have multiple particles, we find the net electric field by adding the electric fields from each particle.

The torque on a dipole in an electric field depends on the moment of the dipole and the electric field. Both of these are vector quantities. The magnitude of the moment of the dipole is given as the product $qd$, where $q$ is the magnitude of the charge of each pole of the dipole, and $d$ is the distance they are separated. The torque is given as

$$ \tau = \vec{p} \times \vec{E} $$

and when the angle between the moment and the electric field is $\theta$, this reduces to

$$ \tau = -pE\sin{\theta} $$

where $p$ and $E$ are the respective magnitudes of the dipole moment and electric field.
