# Electric Potential

The electric potential $V$ due to a particle of charge $q$ at any radial distance $r$ from the particle is


$$ V = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r} $$

This is very similar to the formula for magnitude of an electric field, except it's signed, and drops of proportional to the first power of the distance rather than the square of the distance. The $\frac{1}{r^2}$ in the magnitude of an electric field is related to the electric field being dispersed over an area. It's $\frac{1}{r}$ here because the electric potential is the work done per unit charge in bringing a charge from infinity to a point in the field, so it's integrating the field strength over a distance.
