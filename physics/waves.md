# Waves

Transverse - motion of particles is perpindicular to the direction of the wave's motion

Longitudinal - motion of the particles is in the direction of the wave's motion

A sinusoidal wave moving in the positive direction of an $x$ axis has the form

$$ y(x,t) = y_m \sin(kx - \omega t) $$

$y_m$ is the amplitude (magnitude of the maximum displacement) of the wave k. 

$k$ is the angular wave number; number of cycles per unit of distance. The unit is like rad/m.

$\omega$ is the angular frequency; rad/s

$kx - \omega t$ is the phase

$ \lambda = \frac{2\pi}{k}$ is the wavelength; the distance between crests

$v = \frac{\omega}{k} = \frac{\lambda}{T} = \lambda f$ is the wave speed - the speed of the wave along the medium


$\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}$ is the velocity in the transverse direction
