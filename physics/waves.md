# Waves

Transverse - motion of particles is perpindicular to the direction of the wave's motion

Longitudinal - motion of the particles is in the direction of the wave's motion

A sinusoidal wave moving in the positive direction of an $x$ axis has the form

$$ y(x,t) = y_m \sin(kx - \omega t) $$

$y_m$ is the amplitude (magnitude of the maximum displacement) of the wave k. 

$k$ is the angular wave number; number of cycles per unit of distance. The unit is like rad/m.

$\omega$ is the angular frequency; rad/s

$kx - \omega t$ is the phase

$ \lambda = \frac{2\pi}{k}$ is the wavelength; the distance between crests

$v = \frac{\omega}{k} = \frac{\lambda}{T} = \lambda f$ is the wave speed - the speed of the wave along the medium

$\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}$ is the velocity in the transverse direction

The speed of a wave on a stretched spring is set by properties of the string, not properties of the wave such as frequency or amplitude.

The speed of a wave on a string with tension $\tau$ and linear density $\mu$ is $v = \sqrt{\frac{\tau}{\mu}}$

The average power of, or average rate at which energy is transmitted by, a sinsoidal wave on a stretched string is given by:

$$ P_{\text{avg}} = \frac{1}{2} \mu v \omega^2 {y^2_m} $$ 

Two sinusoidal waves on the same string exhibit interference, adding or canceling according to the principle of superposition. If the two are traveling in the same direction and have the same amplitude $y_m$ and frequency (hence the same wavelength), but differ in phase by a phase constant $\phi$, the result is a single wave with this same frequency:

$$ y\prime (x,t) = \left [ 2y_m \cos{\frac{1}{2}\phi} \right ] \sin{\left ( kx -\omega t + \frac{1}{2} \phi \right)} $$

A standing wave on a string can only occur at resonant frequencies. These are given by $f = \frac{v}{\lambda} = n\frac{v}{2L}$ for $n = 1,2,3,...$. Here, $L$ is the length of the string.

## Longitudinal Waves

If the medium of a wave is air and the wave is longitudinal, the inertial property, corresponding to $\mu$ in a transverse wave long a string, is the volume density $\rho$ of air. The elastic property is then called the **bulk modulus** $B$ and determines the extent to which an element of a medium changes in volume when the pressure on it changes:

$$ B = -V \frac{dP}{dV} $$

where $P$ is pressure, $V$ is the initial volume, and $dP/dV$ denotes the derivative of pressure with respect to volume. Since the volume is inversely proportional to the density, it follows that

$$ B = \rho \frac{dP}{d\rho} $$

where $\rho$ is the initial density and $dP/d\rho$ denotes the derivative of pressure with respect to density. The inverse of bulk modulus gives a substance's compressibility.

Sound is a longitudinal wave, and so the speed of sound in a medium is

$$ v = \sqrt{\frac{B}{\rho}} $$
