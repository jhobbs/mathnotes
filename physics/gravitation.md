# Gravitation

## Newton's Law of Gravitation

Any particle in the universe attracts any other particle with a gravitational force whose magnitude is

$$ F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} $$

where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the two particles, $r$ is the distance between them, and $G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11} N \cdot m^2/kg^2$ is the gravitational constant.
