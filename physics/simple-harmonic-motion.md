# Simple Harmonic Motion

Note: I explore this topic in more mathematical detail in my Ordinary Differential Equations notes on [Undamped Motion](../ode/chapter 06 - problems leading to linear equations of order two/lesson 28 - undamped motion.html).

Simple Harmonic Motion is sinusoidal periodic motion that repeats perfectly over and over. It is a simplified model of motion of objects like a box bouncing on a spring.

Some basic formulas of a particle exhibiting simple harmonic motion follow.

Here, $x_m$ is the amplitude of the displacement the particle, $\omega$ is the [angular frequency](../trigonometry/frequency.html) of the particle's motion, and $\phi$ is the phase angle of the particle, i.e. the position in the cycle of the particle at $t = 0$. 

Displacement: $x = x_m \cos{(\omega t + \phi)}$

Velocity: $v = \frac{dx}{dt} = - x_m \omega \sin{(\omega t + \phi)}$

Acceleration: $a = \frac{dv}{dt} = - x_m \omega^2 \sin{(\omega t + \phi)}$
