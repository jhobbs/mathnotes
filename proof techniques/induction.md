# Induction

For proof by induction that a statement is true for all $n \geq 1$  we show two things:

* That if some statement is true for $n = k$, it must also be true for $n = k + 1$
* That the statement is true for $n = 1$.

Then, since it's true for $n = 1$, it must also be true for $n = 1 + 1 = 2$, and since it's true for $n = 2$, it must also be true for $n = 2 + 1 = 3$, and so on, ad infinitum.
