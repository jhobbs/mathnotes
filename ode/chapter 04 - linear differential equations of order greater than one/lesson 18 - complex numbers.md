# Complex Numbers

## Complex Numbers - Basics

A **pure imaginary number** is the product of a real number and a number $i$ which is defined by the relation $i^2 = -1$.

A **complex number** is one which can be written in the form $a + bi$, where a and be are real numbers.

Note that the complex numbers include both the real numbers and the imaginary numbers.

The $a$ in the complex number $z = a + bi$ is called the **real part of z;** the $b$ is called the **imaginary part of z**.

Note that the imaginary part of a complex number is itself real.

If $ z = a +bi$, then the **conjugate of z,** written as $\bar{z}$, is $\bar{z} = a - bi$.

To form the conjugate of a complex number, simply change the sign of the coefficient of $i$.

If $z = a + bi$, then the **absolute value of z**, written as $\lvert z \rvert$, is $\lvert z \rvert = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.

In a rectangular coordinate system, we can label the $x$-axis as the real axis and the $y$-axis as the imaginary axis, allowing us to represent any complex number $z = a + bi$ graphically by plotting $a$ along the real ($x$) axis and $b$ along the imaginary ($y$) axis:

This also helps establish relationships between a complex numbe rand the polar coordinates of its point. In the following figure, we have represented graphically the complex number $z = x + iy$ and the polar coordinate $(r, \theta)$ of its point:

This image makes the following relationships obvious:

$$ \lvert z \rvert = r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} $$

$$ x = r\cos\theta $$

$$ y = r\sin\theta $$

If we take

$$z = x + yi$$

and call it the **rectangular form of z**, we can replace $x$ and $y$ with their polar equivalents to get:

$$ z = r\cos\theta + ir\sin\theta = r(cos\theta + i\sin\theta) $$

which is called the **polar form of z**.

The polar angle $\theta$ in the figure above is called the **Argument of z**, written as $\text{Arg} z$, and is defined to be the smallest positive angle satisfying the two equalities:

$$ \cos\theta = \frac{x}{\lvert z \rvert}, \quad \sin\theta = \frac{y}{\lvert z \rvert} $$

Writing it as $\text{arg}z$ means that instead of taking the smallest or **principal value** of $\theta$, then:

$$ \text{arg} z = \text{Arg}z \pm 2n\pi,~n = 1,2,3 $$
