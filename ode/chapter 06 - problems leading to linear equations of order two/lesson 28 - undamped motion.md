# Undamped Motion

## Free Undamped Motion (Simple Harmonic Motion)

Free undamped motion, also called simple harmonic motion, happens whenever a particle oscillates back and forth about a fixed point of oscillation in a medium in wich the resistance or damping factor is negligble. This doesn't happen often in reality, because there is usually friction or some other form of resistance to consider.

A particle will be said to execute **simple harmonic motion** if its equation of motion satisfies a differential equation of the form:


$$ \tag{28.11} \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} + \omega_0 x = 0 $$

Where $\omega_0$ is a positive constant and $x$ gives the position of the particle as a function of time $t$.

The solution of $(28.11)$ is:

$$ \tag{28.12} x = c_1 \cos{\omega_0 t} + c_2 \sin{\omega_0 t} $$

An equivalent and more useful way to write the solution $(28.11)$ is:

$$ \tag{28.14} x = c \cos{(w_0 t + \delta)} $$
