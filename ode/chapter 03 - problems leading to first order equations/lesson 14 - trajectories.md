# Isogonal Trajectories

When two curves intersect in a plane, the angle between them is defined to be the angle made by their respective tangents drawn at their point of intersection.

In the above figure, $\alpha$ is the positive angle from the curve $c_1$ with tangent line $L_1$ to the curve $c_2$ with tangent line $L_2$; $\beta$ is the positive angle from the curve $c_2$ to the curve $c_1$. If we call $m_1$ the slope of $L_1$ and $m_2$ the slope of $L_2$, then by a formula in analytic geometry:

$$ \tag{14.11} \tan{\alpha} = \frac{m_2 - m_1}{1+m_1 m_2}; \quad \tan{\beta} = \frac{m_1 - m_2}{1+m_1 m_2}. $$

***Definition 14.12*** A curve which cuts every member of a given 1-parameter family of curves in the *same angle* is called an **isogonal trajectory of the family**.

If we call ${y_1}'$ the slope of a curve of a given 1-parameter family, $y'$ the slope of an isogonal trajectory of the family, and $\alpha$ their angle of intersection measured from the tangent line with slope ${y_1}'$ to the tangent line with slope ${y_1}'$, then by (14.11):

$$ \tag{14.13} \tan{\alpha} = \frac{{y_1}' - y'}{1+y' {y_1}'} $$
