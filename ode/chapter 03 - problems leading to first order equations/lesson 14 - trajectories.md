# Isogonal Trajectories

When two curves intersect in a plane, the angle between them is defined to be the angle made by their respective tangents drawn at their point of intersection.

***Definition 14.12*** A curve which cuts every member of a given 1-parameter family of curves in the *same angle* is called an **isogonal trajectory of the family**.

If we call ${y_1}'$ the slope of a curve of a given 1-parameter family, $y'$ the slope of an isogonal trajectory of the family, and $\alpha$ their angle of intersection measured from the tangent line with slope ${y_1}'$ to the tangent line with slope ${y_1}'$, then by (14.11):

$$ \tag{14.13} \tan{\alpha} = \frac{{y_1}' - y'}{1+y' {y_1}'} $$
