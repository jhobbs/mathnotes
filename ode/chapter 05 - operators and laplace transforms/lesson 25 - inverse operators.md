# Inverse Operators

## Foreword

Recall that a general solution is the sum of the complentary function and a  particular solution i.e. $y = y_c + y_p$.

The complentary function of the differntial equation:

$$ \tag{a} (D^2 -1)y = x^2 $$

is

$$ \tag{b} y_c = c_1 e^x + c_2 e^{-x} $$

and a particular solution of $(a)$ is:

$$ \tag{c} y_p = -x^2 - 2 $$

Therefore the general solution is:

$$ \tag{d} y = -x^2 - 2 + c_1 e^x + c_2 e^{-x} $$

Note that $(b)$ can be obtained by assigning the value of 0 to both arbitrary constants in $(d)$, and so can infinitely other particular solutions.

In this lesson and the next, whenver we refer to a particular solution $y_p$ of a differential equation, we shall mean that particular solution from which all constant multiples of terms in $y_c$ have been eliminated.
