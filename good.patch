-# Differential Equations
-
-Differential equations are mathematical equations that relate functions with their derivatives. They are fundamental tools for modeling how quantities change over time or space, appearing throughout physics, engineering, biology, economics, and many other fields.
-
-## Types of Differential Equations
-
-This section is organized into two main categories:
-
-### [Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)](ordinary-differential-equations/)
-Equations involving functions of a single variable and their derivatives. These describe systems that evolve in one dimension (typically time).
-
-Topics covered:
-- Basic concepts and terminology
-- First-order equations and solution methods
-- Applications of first-order equations
-- Higher-order linear equations
-- Laplace transforms and operator methods
-- Systems of differential equations
-- Series solutions
-- Boundary value problems
-
-### [Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)](partial-differential-equations/)
-Equations involving functions of multiple variables and their partial derivatives. These describe phenomena that vary in multiple dimensions (such as heat diffusion in space and time).
-
-Topics covered:
-- Fourier series
-- Heat equation
-- Wave equation
-- Laplace's equation
-- Separation of variables
-- Boundary conditions and initial value problems
-
-## Why Study Differential Equations?
-
-Differential equations are the language of change. They allow us to:
-- Model physical phenomena (motion, heat, waves, electricity)
-- Predict future behavior of systems
-- Understand equilibrium states and stability
-- Optimize processes and control systems
-- Analyze biological populations and chemical reactions
-
-Whether you're interested in theoretical mathematics or practical applications, differential equations provide powerful tools for understanding our dynamic world.

 *Theorem:* Suppose $a_n \geq 0$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}.$ Then the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{a_n}$ converges iff the sequence of partial sums $s_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n}{a_k}$ is bounded.
 
-*Proof:* Assume the sequence of partial sums $s_n$ is bounded. Since all terms of $a_n$ are nonnegative, $s_n$ is increasing, and by the Monotone Convergence Theorem, must converge, meaning $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{a_n} = \lim_{n \to \infty} s_n$ converges. On the other hand, assume $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{a_n}$ converges. Then $s_n$ is a convergent sequence and is therefore bounded (see [sequences](./sequences.html)).

 *Theorem:* Suppose $a_n \geq a_{n+1} \geq {0}$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ (i.e. $a_n$ is nonnegative and decreasing.) Then the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{a_n}$ converges iff the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{2^n a_{2n}}$ converges.
