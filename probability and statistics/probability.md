# Probability Basics

The probability of A or B is the probability of $A$ plus the probability of $B$ minus the probability of A and B occurring together:

$$ P(A ~ \text{or} ~ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ~ \text{and} ~ B) $$

We have to subtract the overlap between $A$ and $B$ to avoid double counting.
