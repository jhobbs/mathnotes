# Expectation

Let $X$ be a random variable with a probability distribution $f(x).$ The **mean** or **expected value** of $X$ is

$$ \mu = E(X) = \sum_{x}{x f(x)} $$

if $X$ is discrete, and

$$ \mu = E(X) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{x f(x) dx} $$

if $X$ is continuous.

The expected value is the "average value" we expect the random variable to take in the long run.

Note that in the discrete case, the expected value is the dot product of the vector of $x$ values and corresponding vector of $f(x)$ values.
