# IDEAS.md

This file tracks ideas for future features, enhancements, and demonstrations for the mathnotes project.

## Features

- **Tags System**: Setup a tags system to tag documents and browse by tag
  - Add tags field to document frontmatter
  - Create a tags index page
  - Allow filtering/browsing content by tags
  - Display tags on individual pages

## Interactive Demonstrations

- **Reusable Cartesian Plane Library**: Extract the cartesian plane, grid, axes, and zoom functionality from the neighborhood demo into a reusable JavaScript library for other mathematical visualizations

## Content Ideas

(Add future content ideas here)

## Technical Improvements

### TODO Features

- **Attribution/Citation Blocks**: Create structured blocks for referencing content from other authors
  - Explicit citation formatting with proper attribution
  - Support for different citation styles
  - Clear visual distinction from original content
  - Link to original sources when possible
  - Track and index all citations across the site

- **Automatic Numbering and Reference System**: Implement automatic numbering for theorems, definitions, equations, etc. with dynamic cross-references
  - Auto-number theorems, lemmas, propositions, definitions, examples sequentially (e.g., "Theorem 1.1", "Definition 2.3")
  - Support hierarchical numbering by section/chapter
  - Dynamic reference system where `\ref{label}` automatically shows correct number
  - References update automatically when content is reordered or new items are inserted
  - Support for equation numbering and referencing
  - Cross-page references that work across the entire site
  - LaTeX-style labeling system with `{label: my-theorem}` in block metadata
  - Generate "References" or "See Also" sections automatically
  - Note: We're basically reimplementing LaTeX's reference system for the web!

- **Google Structured Data Integration**: Implement Schema.org markup for mathematical content
  - Add JSON-LD structured data for theorems, definitions, and proofs
  - Use MathObject, Article, or EducationalResource schemas
  - Improve SEO and discoverability in search results
  - Enable rich snippets for mathematical content
  - Consider using CreativeWork for cited/attributed content

- **Definition Disambiguation System**: Handle cases where multiple files define the same concept
  - Detect when two or more files contain definitions with the same label or term
  - Provide disambiguation mechanism (e.g., namespace by section or file)
  - Show disambiguation page when referencing ambiguous terms
  - Allow explicit selection of which definition to link to
  - Could use file path or section hierarchy for automatic namespacing
  - Warn during build process about duplicate definition labels
