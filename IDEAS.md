# IDEAS.md

This file tracks ideas for future features, enhancements, and demonstrations for the mathnotes project.

## Features

- **Tags System**: Setup a tags system to tag documents and browse by tag
  - Add tags field to document frontmatter
  - Create a tags index page
  - Allow filtering/browsing content by tags
  - Display tags on individual pages

## Interactive Demonstrations

- **Reusable Cartesian Plane Library**: Extract the cartesian plane, grid, axes, and zoom functionality from the neighborhood demo into a reusable JavaScript library for other mathematical visualizations

## Content Ideas

(Add future content ideas here)

## Technical Improvements

- **Structured Theorem System**: Design and implement a structured theorem system with explicit control over theorem/proof boundaries
  - Must have explicit start/stop boundaries for theorems, proofs, definitions, examples, intuition sections
  - Should be opt-in (won't break existing content)
  - Maintains full control over formatting and structure
  - Ideally preserves markdown compatibility
  - Allows gradual conversion of existing content
  - Potential approaches: custom HTML-like tags, markdown extensions with explicit delimiters, YAML frontmatter blocks, or custom shortcodes
