# Properties of Vectors

Let $\vec{u} = (a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n) \in \mathbb{R}^n$.  The **magnitude**, or length, $\vec{u}$ is denoted as $\|\| \vec{u} \|\|$ and is defined as:

$$ ||\vec{u}|| = \sqrt{ {a_1}^2 + {a_2}^2 \cdots + {a_3}^2 } $$

This is essentially the pythagorean theorem in $n$ dimensions; in $\mathbb{R}^2$ the magnitude of a vector corresponds to the length of the hypotonuse of a right triangle whose other sides are of length $a_1$ and $a_2.$
