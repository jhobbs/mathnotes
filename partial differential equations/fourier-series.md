**Periodic Functions**: A function is **periodic of period** $T$ if $f(x + T) = f(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$.

**Even Functions**: A function that satisfies $f(-x) = f(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$ has a graph that is symmetric with respect to the $y$-axis. We say such a function is **even**. The functions $1, x^2, x^4,\dots$ are examples of even functions, as is $\cos{x}$.

**Odd Functions**: A function $f$ that satisfies $f(-x) = -f(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$ has a graph that is symmetric with respect to the origin. It is said to be an **odd** function. The functions $x, x^3, x^5, \dots$ are examples of odd functions, as are $\sin{x}$ and $\tan{x}$.

Knowing these properties can be useful when evaluating indefinite integrals.


If $f$ is an even piecewise continuous function on $[-a, a]$, then

$$ \int_{-a}^{a} f(x) dx = 2 \int_0^{a} f(x) dx. $$

if $f$ is an odd piecewise continuous function on $[-a, a]$, then

$$ \int_{-a}^{a} f(x) dx = 0. $$
