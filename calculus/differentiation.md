# Differentiation

For $f: (a,b) \to \mathbb{R}, a,b \in \mathbb{R}$, we say the **derivative** of $f$ at $x,$ denoted $f'(x)$ is given by

$$ f'(x) = \lim_{y \to x} \frac{f(y) - f(x)}{y - x}. $$

If this limit exists, the function is said to be differentiable at $x.$ If the limit exists for all $x \in (a,b),$ the function is said to be differentiable on $(a,b).$

*Theorem:* If $f$ is differentiable at $x,$ then it is continuous at $x.$

## Derivative rules

Let $c$ be a real number, and f and g be functions defined on an open interval and differentiable at a point $x$ in that interval.

Linearity: $(f+cg)' = f'(x) + cg'(x).$

Product: $(fg)'(x) = f'(x)g(x) +f(x)g'(x).$

Quotient: $(f/g)'(x) = \frac{f'(x)g(x) -f(x)g'(x)}{\[g(x)\]^2}.$

Let $h(x) = f(g(x)).$

Chain: $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x).$
