# Series

An infinite sequence $a_n$ can be used to form an infinite series, or simply series, by summing its entries:

$$ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \cdots $$

We can define a sequence $s_n$ of partial sums of the infinite series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{a_n}$ by assigning

$$ s_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_n = a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n. $$

The series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{a_n}$ is said to be convergent and to have a sum $m$ if the sequence of partial sums $s_n$ converges to $m.$ If the sequence $s_n$ diverges, then the series is said to diverge.
