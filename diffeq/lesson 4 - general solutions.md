# Lesson 4 - The General Solution of a Differential Equation

***Multiplicity of Solutions of a Differential Equation***

Recall that when integrating, we get a constant of integration, i.e. integrating

$$ y' = e^x $$

results in:

$$ y = e^x + c $$

and integrating twice:

$$ y'' = e^x $$

results in: 

$$ y = e^x + c_1x + c_2 $$

For a large class of differential equations, the solution a diffrential equation of order $n$ has $n$ arbitrary constants. However, this isn't always true.
