# Lesson 4 - The General Solution of a Differential Equation

***Multiplicity of Solutions of a Differential Equation***

Recall that when integrating, we get a constant of integration, i.e. integrating

$$ y' = e^x $$

results in:

$$ y = e^x + c $$

and integrating twice:

$$ y'' = e^x $$

results in: 

$$ y = e^x + c_1x + c_2 $$

For a large class of differential equations, the solution a diffrential equation of order $n$ has $n$ arbitrary constants. However, this isn't always true.

Because all solutions to differential equations involve at least one arbitrary constant, any differential equation that has a solution has *infinitely many solutions*.

***Definition 4.3 - n-parameter family of solutions***

The functions defined by 

(4.31)

$$ y = f(x,c_1,c_2,\cdots,c_n) $$

of the $n + 1$ variables, $x, c_1, c_2, \cdots, c_n$ will be called an **n-parameter family of solutions** of the $n$th order differential equation

(4.32)

$$ F(x,y,y',\cdots,y^{(n)} = 0 $$ 

if for each choice of a set of values $c_1, c_2, \cdots, c_n$, the resultion *function* $f(x)$ defined by (4.31) (it will now define a function of $x$ alone) satisfies (4.32), i.e. if

(4.33)

$$ F(x,f',f'',\cdots,f^{(n)}) = 0 $$

For the classes of differential equations we shall consider, we can now assert: *a differential equation of the *n*th order has an *n*-parameter family of solutions*.
