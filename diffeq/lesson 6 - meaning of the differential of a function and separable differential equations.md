# Differential of a Function of One Independent Variable

*Note: Assume all functions in the lesson are differentiable on an interval.*

Let $y = f(x)$ define $y$ as a function of $x$. Then its derivative $f'(x)$ will give the slope of the curve at any point $P(x,y)$ on it, i.e., it is the slope of the tangent line drawn to the curve at $P$.

From figure 6.12, it's evident that:

$$ f'(x) = tan\alpha = \frac{dy}{\Delta x} \tag{6.1} $$

Hence,

$$ dy = f'(x)\Delta x \tag{6.11} $$

We call $dy$ the **differential** of $y$, i.e. it is the differential of the function defined by $y = f(x)$.

Note that the differential of $y$ ($dy$) is dependent on the abscissa $x$ and on the size of $\Delta x$. That means while $y = f(x)$ defines $y$ as a function of one independent variable $x$, the differential $dy$ is a function of two independent variables - $x$ and $\Delta x$.

***Definition 6.13 The differential of y***
Let $y=f(x)$ define y as a function of x on an interval $I$. The **differential of y**, writen as $dy$ (or $df$) is defined by

$$ (dy)(x,\Delta x) = f'(x)\Delta x \tag{6.14}$$
