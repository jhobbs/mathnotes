These notes are from *Ordinary Differential Equations* by Tenenbaum and Pollard.

They are, in large, copied verbatim or nearly so from that book. In some places I have added my own thoughts or paraphrased the authors' thoughts.

I have made absolutely no effort to distinguish between my thoughts and the material from the source book. These notes are for my own use only, to summarize thoughts from the book.

To make referrring to the book easier, I've reused the books' numbering system for lessons, definitions, etc, so the numbers here match the numbers in the book.
