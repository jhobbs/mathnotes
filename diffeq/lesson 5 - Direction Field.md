# Direction Field

***Definition 5.12*** 

Given the differential equation:

$$ y' = F(x,y), a < x < b \tag{5.11} $$

If $y=f(x)$ or $f(x,y) =0$ defines $y$ as a function of $x$ which satisifies (5.11) on an interval $I$, then the graph of this function is called an integral curve, i.e. it is the graph of a function which is a soltuion of (5.11).

Even if we can't find a solution of (5.11) algebraicly, we can draw a small line element at any point $(x,y)$ for which $x$ is in $I$, to represent the slope of an integral curve at that point. For example, if the value of $y'$ in (5.11) is $2$ at the point $(4,3)$, that means the slop of an integral curve at $(4,3)$ is $2$. To represent that, we can draw a short line at $(4,3)$ with slope $2$. We can repeat that process everywhere we chose to as long as (5.11) is valid there.

These lines are called **line elements**. All of these lines taken together we will call a **direction field**, although the term **slope field** is also commonly used.

***Definition - Isocline***
If

$$ y' = F(x,y) \tag{5.23} $$

then each curve for which 

$$ F(x,y) = k \tag{5.24} $$

where k is any number, will be an **isocline** of the direction field determined by (5.23). 

In plain english, an isocline is a curve in a direction field where all integral curves crossing the isocline have the same slope ($k$) when passing through the isocline. This is similar to a topographic map, where the countor lines represent points on the map with equal elevations.
