# Definition of a Homogenous Function

*Note (jhobbs): Homogenous functions are not specific to differential equations. They have an algebraic definition that can apply to any functions, but it is the first place I've encountered them.*

***Definition 7.1 homogenous of order n***
Let $z = f(x,y)$ define $z$ as a function of $x$ and $y$ in a region $R$. The function $f(x,y)$ is said to be **homogenous of order n** if it can be written as

$$f(x,y) = x^ng(u), \tag{7.11}$$

where $u = y/x$ and $g(u)$ is a function of $u$; or alternatively if it can be written as

$$ f(x,y) = y^nh(h) \tag{7.12}$$

where $u = x/y$ and $h(u)$ is a function of $u$.

***Comment 7.15 Alternate definition***
An alternate definition of a homogenous function is the following. A function $f(x,y)$ is said to be **homogenous of order n** if

$$ f(tx,ty) = t^n(x,y), \tag{7.16} $$

where $t > 0$ and $n$ is a constant.
