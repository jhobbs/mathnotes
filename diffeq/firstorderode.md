# Ordinary Differential Equations

***Definition 3.1 - Ordinary Differential Equation***

Let $f(x)$ define a function of $x$ on an interval $I: a < x < b$. By an **ordinary differential equation** we mean an equation involving $x$, the function $f(x)$ and one or more of its derivatives.

**Note.** It's customary to replace $f(x)$ by $y$.

***Definition 3.2 - Order of a Differential Equation***
The order of a differential equation is the order of the highest derivative involved in the equation.

For example, the differential equation $y' = e^x$ is of the first order, and the differential equation $y'' + y' = 3y$ is  of the second order.
