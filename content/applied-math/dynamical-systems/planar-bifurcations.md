## Zero-Eigenvalue Bifurcations

<!-- TODO: saddle-node, transcritical, and pitchfork bifurcations in 2D systems, relation to 1D normal forms from [[bifurcations]] -->

## Hopf Bifurcation

<!-- TODO: definition, supercritical vs subcritical, birth/death of limit cycles, eigenvalues crossing imaginary axis, normal form -->
