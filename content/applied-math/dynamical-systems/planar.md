title: Planar Systems
---

Here we'll talk about both linear and nonlinear planar systems of the form

$$ \begin{aligned}
\dot{x} & = f(x,y) \\
\dot{y} & = g(x,y).
\end{aligned}
$$

:::definition "Separatrix"
A **separatrix** is the boundary that separating two modes of behavior in a dynamical system.
:::

:::definition "Homoclinic Orbit"
Trajectories that start and end at the same @fixed-point are called **homoclinic orbits.**
:::

:::definition "Heteroclinc Trajectory"
Trajectories that connect two @fixed-point are called **heteroclinic orbits.**
:::

:::definition "Hyperbolic Fixed Point"
A **hyperbolic fixed point** is a @fixed-point for which the real part of both eigenvalues is non-zero.
