## Conservative and Hamiltonian Systems

<!-- TODO: Hamiltonian systems, energy conservation, potential functions, energy level sets, closed orbits -->

## Lyapunov Functions

<!-- TODO: Lyapunov function construction, proving global/asymptotic stability, Lyapunov's theorems -->

## Limit Cycles

<!-- TODO: definition, isolated closed orbits, stable/unstable/half-stable limit cycles, amplitude and frequency -->

## Ruling Out and Proving Closed Orbits

<!-- TODO: Bendixson's theorem (ruling out closed orbits via divergence), Poincaré-Bendixson theorem (proving existence via trapping regions) -->
