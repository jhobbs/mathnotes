## Polar Coordinate Methods

Given a system $\dot{x} = f(x,y), \dot{y} = g(x,y),$ it's sometimes useful, especially for the analysis of limit cycles, to convert to polar coordinates. This can be done the manual way from the start, which leads to needing to solve a system of equations for $\dot{r}$ and $\dot{\theta},$ or we can use these handy formulas, which are equivalent:

$$ \dot{r} = \frac{x \dot{x} + y \dot{y}}{r}, \quad \dot{\theta} = \frac{x \dot{y} - y \dot{x}}{r^2}. $$
