title: Bifurcations
---

:::definition "bifurcation"
In a @dynamical-system with a smoothly varying @parameter $r,$ a sudden change in qualitative or topological behavior of the system, especially the creation, annihilation, or change of stability in its @fixed-points, is called a **bifurcation.**
:::

:::definition "bifurcation point"
The parameter values at which @bifurcations occur are called **bifurcation points.**
:::

You can see some @bifurcations in action with the demo below.

:::definition "Saddle-Node"
The defining feature of a **saddle-node** @bifurcation is that as $r$ crosses the @bifurcation-point, two @fixed-points are created or destroyed (depending on the direction of approach.) If approaching from the direction in which the @fixed-points exist, they will grow closer to each other, until they reach other at the @bifurcation-point, forming a @half-stable point, and then they will be destroyed as $r$ continues on the other side of the @bifurcation-point.
