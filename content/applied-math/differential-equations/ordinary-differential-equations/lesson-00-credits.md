# ODE Credits

The ODE sections of these notes are taken from the book *Ordinary Differential Equations* by Morris Tenenbaum and Harry Pollard.

I used the 1985 Dover edition of the book, often taking text directly or paraphrasing it. Assume, unless otherwise noted, that the material is from that book and credit is due to its authors.

Sometimes, but not always, I make an effort to reuse the section numbers from the book to make it easy to reference things.

However, I did not always paraphrase or take directly, and in places where I did not, I noted that it was my work or my notes.
