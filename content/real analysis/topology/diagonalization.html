        <h3>Cantor's Diagonalization Proof</h3>
        <p>This animation demonstrates how we construct a new binary sequence that differs from every sequence in our countable list, proving that the set of all binary sequences is uncountable.</p>
        <div id="sketch-container"></div>
        <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> The constructed sequence (bottom row) differs from sequence <em>n</em> in position <em>n</em>, ensuring it's not in our original list, even though our original list is countably infinite.</p>
