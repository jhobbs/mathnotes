# Classification of Singularities

Given a Laurent series expansion of a function with an isolated singularity at $z_0$, we have the possibility of the singularity being removable, a pole, or an essential singularity.

:::definition "Removable Singularity"
A **removable singularity** occurs if all negative powers in the Laurent series are zero and the function can be redefined at the singularity to be analytic.
:::

:::definition "Pole"
A **pole** is present if the Laurent series has a finite number of negative power terms. The largest negative exponent (in absolute value) indicates the order of the pole.
:::


:::definition "Essential Singularity"
An **essential singularity** occurs if there are infinitely many negative powers in the Laurent series.
:::

:::theorem
If $f(1/z)$ has a @singularity at $0,$ then $f(z)$ has a @singularity at the @point-at-infinity.
