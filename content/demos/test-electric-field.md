# Test Electric Field Demo Module

This is a test page for the new TypeScript demo module system.

## Electric Field Demo (New Module System)

The demo below uses the new demo module system:

{% include_demo "electric-field" %}

Click to add negative charges (blue), Ctrl+click to add positive charges (red), and spacebar sets them in motion.

## Notes

This demo is now loaded as a TypeScript module from `/static/dist/` instead of using iframes or integrated HTML.
